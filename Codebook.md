Getting and Cleaning Data Project

The following files have been read into separate tables:
1) features.txt
2) activity_labels.txt
3) subject_train.txt
4) x_train.txt
5) y_train.txt
6) subject_test.txt
7) x_test.txt
8) y_test.txt
All of the test and train datasets are merged into a single table using the rbind function in R.

Variable Information: 
1) Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometerand the estimated body acceleration.
2) Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
3) A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
4) An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
